Project Design
•	Navigate the User to see the help from other people	
•	Or user can also sort their interest.
•	Customize options for oxygen, blood, plasma, organ, etc. as per requirement of the user.
•	Add their help for the other people those who want to help .
•	Review their help post by the admin panel or our moderator can also sort their details and verify it manually.
•	After review our admin or moderator can remove their content post on our portal by their section .
•	Provide Date , Location details with API of google location , IP address of the user .
•	User share their requirement as per their need and delete their post , or if someone is chatting with user it will also shown , in it that how many people contact them .
•	User will also get all the tracking information on the particular post.
As the goal of the system is to make the process of posting their need as simple as possible for the user, the functionality provided through the web post posting system is restricted to that which most pertinent to accomplish the desired task. All of the functions outlined above, with the exceptions of account creation and management, will be used every time a user post . By not including extraneous functions, I am moving towards my goal of simplifying post.
The Database & the Components:

The structure of the system can be divided into three main logical components. The first component must provide some form of which types of help they need , allowing the Moderator  to control what can be post by user. The second component is the post posting  system and provides the functionality for user to place their post and supply all necessary details. The third and final logical component is the post retrieval system. Used by the Moderator   to keep track of all posts which have been placed, this component takes care of retrieving and displaying post information, as well as updating posts which have already been processed.
 
 
Innovation In Model
It is the purpose of the new system to address all the problems plaguing the present system. This system will do the analyzing and storing of information either automatically or interactively. This will require the input of necessary data and record of help posting and delivery their need  and then a report is generated.


The proposed system will also have some other features such as:
1.	Accuracy in handling of data
2.	The volume of asking one by one  will be greatly reduced.
3.	Fast rate of operation as in making the posted help  available and delivered  on time.
4.	Flexibility (l.e. it can be accessed at any time)
5.	Better storage and faster retrieval system
 

 
 
Implementation
1.	So this first snap shows we are working on admin panel .
 


2.	This snap shows all the file directory on which we are working on.
